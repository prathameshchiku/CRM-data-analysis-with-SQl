# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) dataset to gain valuable insights and trends. The dataset encompasses sales data from the year 2017, including information about products, salespersons, and customers.

Using SQL queries, we extracted meaningful insights from the dataset, such as top-selling products, salesperson performance, and customer behavior. These insights provide valuable information for process improvement and strengthening customer relationships.

To enhance the understanding of the findings, we utilized Excel to visualize the extracted insights. Visual representations, including charts and graphs, were created to effectively communicate the trends and patterns discovered.

Through this project, we aim to contribute to the optimization of processes for the upcoming year and enable organizations to make data-driven decisions that enhance sales strategies and customer engagement.
